# Simplex Tutorial

Welcome to the Simplex programming language tutorial. This series will take you from your first line of code to building distributed, AI-powered applications.

---

## Who Is This For?

This tutorial assumes you have some programming experience in any language. You don't need to know Rust, Erlang, or any specific language—we'll explain everything from the ground up.

If you've written code in Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, or similar languages, you'll feel right at home.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:

- How to write and run Simplex programs
- The type system and how it keeps your code safe
- Functions, closures, and control flow
- Actors: Simplex's core abstraction for building reliable systems
- Message passing and concurrent programming
- Fault tolerance through supervision
- AI integration as a first-class feature
- Building and deploying a complete application

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Read in order**: Each chapter builds on previous ones
2. **Type the code**: Don't just read—type each example yourself
3. **Experiment**: Modify the examples and see what happens
4. **Check your understanding**: Try the exercises at the end of each chapter

## Setting Up

Before starting, install Simplex:

```bash
# macOS
brew install simplex

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://simplex-lang.org/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
simplex --version
```

Create a directory for your tutorial work:

```bash
mkdir simplex-tutorial
cd simplex-tutorial
```

You're ready to begin. Let's start with [Chapter 1: Variables and Types](01-variables-and-types.md).
