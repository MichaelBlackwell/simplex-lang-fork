error[E0401]: cannot read file

This error occurs when the compiler finds a file but cannot read its contents.

Example of erroneous code:
    $ sxc build protected_file.sx
    error[E0401]: cannot read file: protected_file.sx

Common causes:
- File permission issues (no read access)
- File is locked by another process
- File is corrupted or unreadable
- Disk I/O errors
- File is actually a directory
- Symbolic link pointing to inaccessible location

To fix this:

1. Check and fix file permissions:
    $ ls -la myfile.sx
    ---------- 1 user group 100 Jan 1 12:00 myfile.sx

    $ chmod +r myfile.sx  # add read permission
    $ chmod 644 myfile.sx # standard file permissions

2. Verify you own the file or have group access:
    $ chown $USER myfile.sx  # change ownership if needed

3. Check if file is locked:
    $ lsof myfile.sx  # see if another process has it open

4. Verify it's a regular file:
    $ file myfile.sx
    myfile.sx: ASCII text  # should show text, not directory

5. If it's a symlink, check the target:
    $ ls -la myfile.sx
    myfile.sx -> /some/other/path.sx
    $ ls -la /some/other/path.sx  # check target exists and is readable

6. Check disk health if persistent issues:
    $ dmesg | tail  # check for disk errors on Linux
    $ diskutil verifyVolume /  # on macOS

7. Try copying the file:
    $ cp myfile.sx myfile_copy.sx  # if this fails, disk issue likely
