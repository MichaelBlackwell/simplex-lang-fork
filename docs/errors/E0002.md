error[E0002]: unexpected end of file

This error occurs when the parser reaches the end of the file but was expecting
more code to complete a syntactic construct.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        let x = 42;
    // error: unexpected end of file (missing closing brace)

Common causes:
- Missing closing braces `}`
- Missing closing parentheses `)`
- Missing closing brackets `]`
- Incomplete function or struct definitions
- Unclosed string literals

To fix this, check for:
1. Matching opening and closing delimiters
2. Complete all function bodies
3. Close all struct and enum definitions

Correct example:
    fn main() {
        let x = 42;
    }  // ok: properly closed
