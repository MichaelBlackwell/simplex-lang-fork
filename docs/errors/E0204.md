error[E0204]: invalid cast

This error occurs when you try to cast a value to a type that is not
compatible with the source type.

Example of erroneous code:
    struct Point { x: i64, y: i64 }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
        let n = p as i64;  // error: cannot cast `Point` to `i64`

        let s = "hello";
        let n = s as i64;  // error: cannot cast `str` to `i64`
    }

Common causes:
- Trying to cast between unrelated types
- Casting structs to primitive types
- Casting strings to numbers (use parsing instead)
- Incorrect understanding of what types can be cast

Valid casts in Simplex:
- Between numeric types: i64 as f64, f64 as i64, i32 as i64
- Integer to/from raw pointer (for FFI)
- Enum to integer (underlying representation)

Correct examples:
    fn main() {
        // Numeric casts
        let i: i64 = 42;
        let f: f64 = i as f64;  // ok: 42.0

        let f: f64 = 3.14;
        let i: i64 = f as i64;  // ok: 3 (truncated)

        // Integer size conversions
        let small: i32 = 100;
        let big: i64 = small as i64;  // ok: widening

        let big: i64 = 100;
        let small: i32 = big as i32;  // ok: narrowing (may lose data)
    }

For string to number conversion, use parsing:
    fn main() {
        let s = "42";
        let n = parse_i64(s);  // ok: parse function
    }

For complex type conversions, implement conversion methods:
    impl Point {
        fn to_tuple(self) -> (i64, i64) {
            (self.x, self.y)
        }
    }
