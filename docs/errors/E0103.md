error[E0103]: cannot find struct in this scope

This error occurs when you try to use a struct that hasn't been defined
or imported into the current scope.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };  // error: cannot find struct `Point`
    }

    fn create() -> Config {  // error: cannot find struct `Config`
        Config { debug: true }
    }

Common causes:
- Using a struct that hasn't been defined
- Typo in struct name (struct names are case-sensitive)
- Struct defined in another module without import
- Trying to construct an enum as if it were a struct

To fix this, define the struct or import it:

Correct examples:
    struct Point {
        x: i64,
        y: i64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };  // ok
    }

With module imports:
    use config::Config;

    fn create() -> Config {
        Config::default()  // ok: struct is imported
    }

If you're trying to create an enum variant, use the correct syntax:
    enum Option<T> {
        Some(T),
        None,
    }

    fn main() {
        let x = Option::Some(42);  // ok: enum variant syntax
        // NOT: let x = Some { value: 42 };  // wrong
    }
