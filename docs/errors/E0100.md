error[E0100]: cannot find value in this scope

This error occurs when you try to use a variable that hasn't been declared
in the current scope.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        println(x);  // error: cannot find value `x` in this scope
    }

    fn example() {
        if true {
            let y = 10;
        }
        println(y);  // error: `y` is not in scope here
    }

Common causes:
- Using a variable before declaring it
- Typo in variable name
- Variable went out of scope
- Forgetting to declare the variable

To fix this, declare the variable before use:

Correct examples:
    fn main() {
        let x = 42;
        println(x);  // ok: x is declared
    }

    fn example() {
        let y: i64;
        if true {
            y = 10;
        } else {
            y = 0;
        }
        println(y);  // ok: y is in scope
    }

If you meant to use a different variable, check for typos:
    fn main() {
        let count = 5;
        println(cont);  // error: did you mean `count`?
    }
