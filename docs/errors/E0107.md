error[E0107]: no method found

This error occurs when you try to call a method that doesn't exist
on the type.

Example of erroneous code:
    struct Point {
        x: i64,
        y: i64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 3, y: 4 };
        let d = p.distance();  // error: no method `distance` found for `Point`
    }

    fn example() {
        let s = "hello";
        s.reverse();  // error: no method `reverse` on `str`
    }

Common causes:
- Method not defined in impl block
- Typo in method name
- Calling a function as if it were a method
- Method requires a trait that isn't implemented
- Method is for a different type

To fix this, implement the method or use the correct syntax:

Correct examples:
    struct Point {
        x: i64,
        y: i64,
    }

    impl Point {
        fn distance(self) -> f64 {
            sqrt((self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y) as f64)
        }
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 3, y: 4 };
        let d = p.distance();  // ok: method is implemented
    }

If it's a standalone function, not a method:
    fn reverse_string(s: str) -> str { /* ... */ }

    fn main() {
        let s = "hello";
        let r = reverse_string(s);  // ok: function call
    }
