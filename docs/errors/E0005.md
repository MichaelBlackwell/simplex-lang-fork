error[E0005]: unclosed delimiter

This error occurs when an opening delimiter (parenthesis, brace, or bracket)
is not matched by a corresponding closing delimiter.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        let arr = [1, 2, 3;   // error: unclosed `[`
        println(arr);
    }

    fn compute(x: i64 {       // error: unclosed `(`
        x * 2
    }

Common causes:
- Forgetting to close parentheses in function calls
- Missing closing braces in blocks
- Unclosed array literals
- Nested delimiters with missing inner closings

To fix this, ensure every opening delimiter has a matching close:
- `(` must be closed with `)`
- `{` must be closed with `}`
- `[` must be closed with `]`

Correct examples:
    fn main() {
        let arr = [1, 2, 3];  // ok: properly closed
        println(arr);
    }

    fn compute(x: i64) -> i64 {  // ok: properly closed
        x * 2
    }

Tip: Many editors highlight matching delimiters. Use this feature
to find unmatched pairs.
