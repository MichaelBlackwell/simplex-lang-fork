error[E0001]: unexpected token

This error occurs when the parser encounters a token that doesn't fit the
expected grammar at the current position in your code.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        let x = @;  // error: unexpected token `@`
    }

Common causes:
- Using an invalid character or symbol
- Typos in keywords or operators
- Missing operators between expressions

To fix this, check for:
1. Typos in your code
2. Invalid characters that don't belong in Simplex syntax
3. Missing punctuation like commas, semicolons, or operators

Correct example:
    fn main() {
        let x = 42;  // ok
    }
