error[E0106]: no variant on enum

This error occurs when you try to use an enum variant that doesn't exist
on the enum type.

Example of erroneous code:
    enum Color {
        Red,
        Green,
        Blue,
    }

    fn main() {
        let c = Color::Yellow;  // error: no variant `Yellow` on enum `Color`
    }

    enum Status {
        Active,
        Inactive,
    }

    fn check(s: Status) {
        match s {
            Status::Active => {},
            Status::Inactive => {},
            Status::Unknown => {},  // error: no variant `Unknown`
        }
    }

Common causes:
- Typo in variant name (variants are case-sensitive)
- Using a variant that was never defined
- Confusing variants between different enums
- Variant was removed or renamed

To fix this:
1. Check the enum definition for available variants
2. Fix any typos in the variant name
3. Add the variant to the enum if needed

Correct examples:
    enum Color {
        Red,
        Green,
        Blue,
        Yellow,  // add variant if needed
    }

    fn main() {
        let c = Color::Yellow;  // ok
    }

To see available variants, check the enum definition:
    enum Status {
        Active,    // use as Status::Active
        Inactive,  // use as Status::Inactive
    }
