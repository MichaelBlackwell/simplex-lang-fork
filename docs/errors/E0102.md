error[E0102]: cannot find type in this scope

This error occurs when you reference a type that hasn't been defined
or imported into the current scope.

Example of erroneous code:
    fn main() {
        let p: Point = create_point();  // error: cannot find type `Point`
    }

    fn process(data: MyData) {  // error: cannot find type `MyData`
    }

Common causes:
- Using a type that hasn't been defined
- Typo in type name
- Forgetting to import the type from another module
- Type defined in a different file without proper import

To fix this:
1. Define the struct/enum/type alias before using it
2. Import the type from its module
3. Check for typos (types are case-sensitive)

Correct examples:
    struct Point {
        x: f64,
        y: f64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let p: Point = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };  // ok
    }

For imports:
    use geometry::Point;  // import Point from geometry module

    fn main() {
        let p: Point = Point::new();  // ok
    }

Note: Built-in types are always available:
- i64, i32, i16, i8 (signed integers)
- u64, u32, u16, u8 (unsigned integers)
- f64, f32 (floating point)
- bool (boolean)
- str (string)
