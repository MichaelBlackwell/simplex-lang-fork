error[E0104]: no field on type

This error occurs when you try to access a field that doesn't exist
on a struct type.

Example of erroneous code:
    struct Point {
        x: i64,
        y: i64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
        println(p.z);  // error: struct `Point` has no field `z`
    }

    struct User {
        name: str,
        age: i64,
    }

    fn main() {
        let u = User { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
        println(u.email);  // error: struct `User` has no field `email`
    }

Common causes:
- Typo in field name
- Accessing a field that was never defined
- Confusing fields between different structs
- Field is private and not accessible

To fix this:
1. Check the struct definition for available fields
2. Fix any typos in the field name
3. Add the field to the struct if needed

Correct examples:
    struct Point {
        x: i64,
        y: i64,
        z: i64,  // add field if needed
    }

    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };
        println(p.z);  // ok: field exists
    }

To see available fields, check the struct definition:
    struct User {
        name: str,   // available as .name
        age: i64,    // available as .age
    }
