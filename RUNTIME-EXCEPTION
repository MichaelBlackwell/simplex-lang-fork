Simplex Runtime Library Exception

As a special exception, the copyright holders of Simplex give you permission
to link programs written in Simplex with any library or runtime, and to
distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that:

1. You comply with the terms and conditions of the license of that library
   or runtime.

2. The executable is not itself a modification of the Simplex compiler,
   runtime, or standard library.

3. You do not remove or alter any copyright notices in the Simplex source
   files.

This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why the executable
might be covered by the GNU Affero General Public License.

---

In plain terms: Programs you write IN Simplex can be licensed however you
want (proprietary, MIT, GPL, etc.). This exception only applies to your
application code, not to modifications of the Simplex compiler or runtime
itself.

The Simplex compiler, runtime, and standard library remain under AGPL-3.0.
