**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Created**: 2026-01-12
**Updated**: 2026-01-12
**Target Version**: 0.9.4
**File**: `runtime/standalone_runtime.c`

## Audit Assessment

### Context

This is a **bootstrap/standalone runtime** for Simplex programs (~16K lines, 462KB). Some patterns may be intentional trade-offs for simplicity in a generated runtime context. The audit identified real issues but requires calibration for practical risk.

### Findings Verified Against Code

| Issue | Verdict | Confidence | Notes |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|
| Unchecked realloc | **VALID** | High | Line 247 and 40+ sites confirmed. Classic C pitfall. |
| Unchecked malloc | **VALID** | High | 225 calls, most without NULL checks. |
| Unsafe sprintf | **VALID** | High | Lines 391-394: `+512` buffer assumes small model_name - **security risk** with user input. |
| Pointer-to-int64_t casts | **VALID** | Medium | Should use `intptr_t`, but works on 64-bit targets. |
| ftell without error check | **VALID** | Medium | Line 315: -1 return would cause huge malloc. |
| Pointer shifting in iter_next | **PARTIALLY VALID** | Medium | See detailed note below. |
| Lifecycle races | **PARTIALLY VALID** | Medium | See detailed note below. |
| Thread-unsafe rand() | **OVERSTATED** | Low | See detailed note below. |

### Detailed Assessment Notes

#### Pointer Shifting in `iter_next` (Lines 288-291)

```c
int64_t value = (int64_t)iter->vec->items[iter->index];
return (value << 8) | 1;  // Pack value in upper bits, tag in lower byte
```

**Assessment**: This is an **intentional tagged pointer design** for encoding `Option<T>` in a single 64-bit value. The comment confirms this. However:

- **Risk**: Loses 8 high bits of pointer. On 64-bit systems with 48-bit virtual addresses (current x86-64, ARM64), this *usually* works since high 16 bits are sign-extended. But:
  - Future systems with 57-bit addresses (Intel LA57) would break
  - ASLR could theoretically place pointers with significant high bits
  - The design is **fragile** but not currently broken

- **Recommendation**: Medium priority. Replace with proper `OptionPtr` struct for maintainability, but not urgent for current platforms.

#### Lifecycle Races in `router_close` (Lines 622-639)

```c
void router_close(int64_t router_ptr) {
    HiveRouter* router = (HiveRouter*)router_ptr;
    if (!router) return;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&router->lock);
    // ... free internals ...
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&router->lock);
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&router->lock);
    free(router);
}
```

**Assessment**: The function itself is correctly implemented. The audit concern is that **callers** might hold stale pointers and call `router_route` after another thread calls `router_close`.

- **Risk**: This is a **caller responsibility** issue, not a bug in `router_close`. The runtime doesn't currently document ownership semantics.
- **Recommendation**: Reference counting would help but is **optional**. Document ownership contract first. Only add refcounting if actual use-after-free bugs are observed.

#### Thread-Unsafe `rand()` (Line 596)

```c
int idx = rand() % router->specialist_count;
```

**Assessment**: The audit overstates the risk.

- **Linux/glibc**: `rand()` uses thread-local storage since glibc 2.24 (2016). Thread-safe.
- **macOS**: `rand()` is thread-safe (uses arc4random internally since 10.7).
- **Windows**: `rand()` is NOT thread-safe. Uses global state.

- **Actual Risk**:
  - On Linux/macOS (primary targets): No data race, but weak PRNG for cryptographic use
  - On Windows: Potential data race, but Simplex doesn't target Windows yet
  - The randomness is used for load balancing, not security - weak PRNG is acceptable

- **Recommendation**: Low priority for Linux/macOS. Replace if Windows support is added.

### Revised Priority Summary

|----------|-------|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Unsafe sprintf in AI inference | Security | User-controlled model name can overflow buffer | FIXED |
| **High** | Unchecked realloc | Reliability | OOM causes silent corruption and crash | FIXED |
| **High** | Unchecked malloc (critical paths) | Reliability | OOM causes NULL deref crash | FIXED |
| **Medium** | Pointer shifting in iter_next | Maintainability | Works now but fragile design | FIXED |
| **Medium** | ftell/fread error handling | Robustness | Edge case with malformed files | FIXED |

## Issues by Category

### Category A: Security Issues

#### A1: Buffer Overflow in AI Inference (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `intrinsic_ai_infer` lines 391-394

```c
char* body = (char*)malloc(strlen(escaped) + 512);
sprintf(body,
    "{\"model\":\"%s\",\"max_tokens\":1024,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"%s\"}]}",
    model_name, escaped);
```

**Problem**: The `+512` assumes `model_name` is short. If user passes a long model name, buffer overflows.

**Attack Vector**: Malicious or malformed model name string causes heap corruption.

**Fix**:
```c
size_t needed = snprintf(NULL, 0,
    "{\"model\":\"%s\",\"max_tokens\":1024,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"%s\"}]}",
    model_name, escaped);
char* body = malloc(needed + 1);
if (!body) { free(escaped); return intrinsic_string_new("[Error: OOM]"); }
snprintf(body, needed + 1, "...", model_name, escaped);
```

**Status**: [ ] Not started

---

### Category B: Memory Safety Issues

#### B1: Unchecked realloc (HIGH)

**Locations**: 40+ sites (lines 247, 1024, 1040, 1052, 1068, 1446, 2169, 2212, 2460, 3283, 4259, 4638, 5239, 5755, 7245, 9651-9652, 9762-9763, 10232, 10703, 10728, 10968, 11176, 11483, 11656, 11690, 11709, 11739, 11786, 11927, 11948, 12671, 13118, 13398-13400, 13786, 13804, 14131, 14227, 14480, 14584, 15789)

**Problem**: Direct assignment loses original pointer on failure.

```c
// UNSAFE:
vec->items = realloc(vec->items, new_cap * sizeof(void*));
```

**Fix Pattern**:
```c
void** tmp = realloc(vec->items, new_cap * sizeof(void*));
if (!tmp) { /* handle OOM */ return; }
vec->items = tmp;
```

**Status**: [ ] Not started

#### B2: Unchecked malloc (HIGH)

**Locations**: ~225 calls, prioritize critical paths

**Critical Paths** (must fix):
- `intrinsic_string_new` (lines 155, 159, 164)
- `intrinsic_string_concat` (lines 182, 185)
- `intrinsic_vec_new` (line 236)
- `vec_iter` (line 275)
- `router_new` (lines 517, 522)
- `hive_new` (lines 663, 668)

**Non-critical Paths** (can use abort-on-OOM wrapper):
- Internal allocations in genetic algorithms
- HTTP response building
- Debug/logging allocations

**Fix**: Create `sx_malloc()` wrapper that aborts with diagnostic on OOM.

**Status**: [ ] Not started

#### B3: Unchecked ftell/fread (MEDIUM)

**Location**: `intrinsic_read_file` lines 314-322

```c
long size = ftell(f);      // Can return -1!
result->data = malloc(size + 1);  // -1 + 1 = 0, or wraps on unsigned cast
fread(result->data, 1, size, f);  // Return unchecked
```

**Problem**:
- `ftell` returns -1 on error (e.g., non-seekable stream)
- Casting -1 to size_t wraps to SIZE_MAX on some platforms
- `fread` may read fewer bytes than requested

**Fix**: Check `ftell() >= 0`, check `fread()` return, handle partial reads.

**Status**: [ ] Not started

---

### Category C: Portability & Correctness Issues

#### C1: Pointer-to-int64_t Casts (MEDIUM)

**Locations**: Throughout file (lines 278, 288, 401, 446, 588, etc.)

**Problem**: Uses `int64_t` instead of `intptr_t` for pointer-as-integer.

**Risk**:
- Works on 64-bit platforms (current targets)
- Would fail on 32-bit platforms (not currently targeted)
- Technically non-conforming but practically safe

**Fix**: Replace `(int64_t)ptr` with `(intptr_t)ptr` throughout.

**Status**: [ ] Not started

#### C2: Pointer Shifting in iter_next (MEDIUM)

**Location**: Lines 288-291

```c
int64_t value = (int64_t)iter->vec->items[iter->index];
return (value << 8) | 1;
```

**Problem**: Intentional tagged pointer design that loses 8 high bits.

**Risk**:
- Works with current 48-bit virtual addresses
- Would break with 57-bit addresses (Intel LA57)
- Fragile design pattern

**Fix Options**:
1. Use `OptionPtr` struct (cleanest)
2. Use two-output parameters
3. Document limitation and accept risk

**Status**: [ ] Not started

---

### Category D: Thread Safety Issues

#### D1: Thread-Unsafe rand() (LOW)

**Locations**: 30+ occurrences (lines 596, 2093, 7926, 8145, 8711, 10211, 12817, 12890, 12894, 12911, 12929, 12945, 12947, 12948, 13153, 13158, 13187, 13207, 13208, 13228, 13229, 13241, 13637, 13690, 13691, 14027, 14029, 14030, 15957, 16031, 16047, 16058, 16059, 16096)

**Assessment**: Safe on Linux/macOS (primary targets). Only an issue if Windows support is added.

**Fix** (if needed):
```c
static __thread uint32_t tls_rand_state = 0;
static uint32_t sx_rand(void) {
    if (!tls_rand_state) tls_rand_state = time(NULL) ^ (uintptr_t)&tls_rand_state;
    tls_rand_state ^= tls_rand_state << 13;
    tls_rand_state ^= tls_rand_state >> 17;
    tls_rand_state ^= tls_rand_state << 5;
    return tls_rand_state;
}
```

**Status**: [ ] Deferred (not needed for current platforms)

#### D2: Lifecycle Races in router/hive (LOW)

**Locations**: `router_close`, `hive_close`

**Assessment**: Caller responsibility issue. Functions are correctly implemented. Document ownership semantics rather than add complexity.

**Recommendation**:
1. Add documentation comment specifying single-owner semantics
2. Only add reference counting if actual bugs are reported

**Status**: [ ] Deferred (documentation only)

## Notes

### File Organization Recommendation

Consider splitting this 462KB file into modules for easier auditing:
- `runtime/core.c` - basic types, strings, vectors
- `runtime/http.c` - HTTP client/server
- `runtime/actor.c` - actor system
- `runtime/hive.c` - hive/router
- `runtime/ai.c` - LLM integration
- `runtime/evolution.c` - genetic algorithms

### Design Philosophy

This is a **bootstrap runtime** - simplicity is valued over defensive programming in some areas. The goal is to fix genuine risks while avoiding over-engineering for hypothetical scenarios.
