WHAT THIS MEANS

1. The Simplex compiler, runtime, and standard library are AGPL-3.0.
   - If you modify and distribute them, you must share your source code.
   - If you run a modified version as a network service, you must share source.

2. Programs YOU write in Simplex are yours.
   - License them however you want (proprietary, MIT, GPL, etc.)
   - The Runtime Exception ensures your code is not "infected" by AGPL.

3. Contributing back is appreciated but not legally required.
   - AGPL requires source availability, not contribution to this repo.
