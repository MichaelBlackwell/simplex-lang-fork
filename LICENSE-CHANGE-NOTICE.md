# License Change Notice

## Summary

As of **version 0.5.1**, the Simplex Programming Language is licensed under:

**AGPL-3.0-or-later WITH Simplex-Runtime-Exception**

## Why the Change?

The Simplex project has moved from MIT to AGPL-3.0 to protect against
"Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" tactics and to ensure that improvements
to the compiler, runtime, and standard library remain available to the
open source community.

## What This Means for You

### If you're writing programs IN Simplex:
**Nothing changes.** The Runtime Exception means your programs can be
licensed however you want - proprietary, MIT, Apache, GPL, or any other
license. Your code is yours.

### If you're modifying the Simplex compiler/runtime:
You must make your source code available under AGPL-3.0 if you:
- Distribute your modified version, OR
- Run your modified version as a network service (e.g., a cloud IDE)

### If you're using Simplex ≤0.5.0:
Those versions remain under the MIT License. You can continue using them
under MIT terms.
