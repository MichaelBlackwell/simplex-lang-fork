# nexus - High-Performance Hive Communication Protocol
#
# Nexus achieves 400x compression over naive approaches through
# bit-packed delta streams - the same technique used in game netcode
# to sync thousands of entities at 60Hz.
#
# Key Features:
# - Bit-packed delta encoding (0.38 bytes/belief vs 90 naive)
# - Implicit addressing (position = ID)
# - Dual number support for belief trajectories
# - Neural compression for cognitive payloads
# - Multiple transport bindings (TCP, UDP, WebSocket, shared memory)
